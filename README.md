# snake_
#by cecebzm
#the difference with the last one, firstly I programmed this one with pygame, 
#secondly this one ends as soon as the snake bump into the wall, the end of the game doesn't depend of the user but inadequacy to control the length of the snake 
#because it keeps getting bigger, I thought to make it as in real life, it eats and at a certain point the snake make a short sleep time to digest and recover
#the user can be able to know the score while a meat is eaten before the snake sleep (=end of the game, the user should sleep a little also;) HAÂ§! a good score it must be! )
